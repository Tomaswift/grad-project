What started as entertainment became an obsession that destroyed my life. It took me 5 years of therapy and Gamblers Anonymous to rebuild some semblance of normalcy."</p>

It was seeing the look in my daughter's eyes when she realized she couldn't go to the college she'd worked so hard to get into because I had gambled away her education fund. That moment of devastating her future haunts me daily. Children are the hidden victims of gambling addiction."</p>
